This repo is about my result of [Adding features to our Bouncing Balls Demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Adding_bouncing_balls_features) at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

Move the white ball with w, d, s and a, up, right, down and left respectively to eat up all the color balls.
